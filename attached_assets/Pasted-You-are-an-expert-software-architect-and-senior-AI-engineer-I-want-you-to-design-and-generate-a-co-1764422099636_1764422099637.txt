You are an expert software architect and senior AI engineer.
I want you to design and generate a complete, production-quality Search Algorithms Visualization GUI Project exactly based on the following academic specifications:


---

🎯 Project Title

"Interactive Search Algorithms Visualization & Comparison Tool"


---

📌 Core Requirements (Must Follow Strictly)

1. GUI Application

Build a clean, interactive GUI application.

Allow users to:

Drag & Drop a problem file

OR construct a problem manually (add nodes, blocks, obstacles, edges…)

Choose a search algorithm from a list

Start / Pause / Reset execution

View real-time visualization of search steps



2. Supported Algorithms

Include correct implementations of:

BFS

DFS

UCS

Greedy Best-First Search

A*


Additionally create modular support for optional algorithms:

Hill Climbing

Beam Search

IDA*


3. Supported Problem Types

Implement at least two:

Grid-based pathfinding

Maze solving

Graph (nodes & edges) search

8-Puzzle

Custom problem


4. Visualization Requirements

The visualization must show:

Step-by-step exploration

Highlighted visited nodes

Frontier (open list)

Cost values g, h, f (for informed algorithms)

Final optimal path


Step animation should be smooth and interactive.

5. Performance Analysis

After each run, automatically display:

Execution time

Number of visited nodes

Path cost

Memory usage (approximation)

Comparison tables or charts between algorithms

📚 Deliverables to Generate

You must produce:

A) System Architecture

High-level architecture

Class diagrams

Data flow

State management design

Visualization engine design


B) Complete Source Code

A full working project including:

Frontend GUI

All algorithms

Visualization logic

Performance metrics

Drag & Drop feature

Clean modular structure

Comments and documentation


C) Proposal Document (PDF outline)

Contains:

Problem definition

System design

Algorithms overview

GUI mockups

Example problems


D) Research-Oriented Report

Related work

Evaluation metrics

Algorithm comparison

Screenshots of results

Future improvements


E) Presentation Slides (Outline)

For a professional academic presentation.


---

🛠 Technical Stack

Use a clean, modern, scalable technology such as:

React (preferred)

Or Python (PyQt / Tkinter)

Or JavaFX


If React is selected, include:

Components for grid / graph rendering

Canvas-based visualization

State management (Context API / Redux)

Hooks for animation and controls

File drag & drop handler



---

🎨 Expectations for Code Quality

Clear folder structure

Reusable components

Clean algorithm implementations

Separation of concerns

Fully commented code

Extensible design (easy to add more algorithms)



---

🧠 What I want you to output

Produce the following in order:

1. Full system architecture description


2. Complete folder structure


3. Detailed explanation of the visualization engine


4. All search algorithms implemented


5. Full React application code (or chosen tech)


6. Mockups for the GUI


7. Performance metrics module


8. Proposal document (ready to export)


9. Research report (ready to export)


10. Presentation slides outline



Make everything consistent, professional, and 100% aligned with the academic requirements above.
